# hot_100

Generates random pop songs from 1958-1999

This program picks 100 songs that were on the pop charts from 1958 - 1999. It writes them to an output file, then deletes what it has picked, so the CSV file is gradually getting consumed. I make certain the same song cannot show up twice in the same playlist.

I use a website called Soundiiz. I drag the output file there and it imports it into my YouTube library.
